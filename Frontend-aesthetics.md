## frontend_aesthetics
- Typography: Use a distinctive, modern sans like Satoshi or General Sans for headings and a readable serif or neutral sans for body. Avoid Inter/Roboto/Arial.
- Color & theme: Commit to a strong theme (e.g. deep charcoal background, electric accent). Use CSS variables for colors and spacing for consistency.
- Layout: Generous whitespace, clear vertical rhythm, max-width containers, balanced padding. Prefer asymmetric sections over rigid 50/50 splits.
- Motion: Add subtle transitions and micro-interactions (hover states, card lift, button press states). Use Tailwind’s transition and transform utilities.
- Avoid: Generic AI aesthetics (white + purple gradients, stock illustrations, generic cards with equal padding everywhere).
- Output: Clean, production-ready React + Tailwind with semantic HTML, mobile-first and accessible.
